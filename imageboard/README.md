# php-simple-imageboard

In the blink of an eye, Ai made this imageboard. It is less than 1/100th the code base size of vichan yet has the same basic functionality. Want something changed? just feed it to Ai and tell it what to do.

uses sqlite3 so to make a new board just put the app in seperate dir

sqlite3 is easy to make an admin area for. either edit the sqlite3 db directly with a sqlite3 editor or have ai easily make you a seperate php file that is an admin area. Keeping the admin area seperate from the board code is a decent idea.
